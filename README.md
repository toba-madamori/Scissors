# Scissor
An application to make working with and handling links easier. 


## Features
### URL Shortening:
Scissor allows you to take a long URL and create a shortened `alias` that when  accessed as a path on the platform, redirects you to your original URL.

### Custom Aliases:
Scissor also allows you to customize the `alias` generated. Users can choose a custom `alias` that reflects their brand or content. \
This is particularly useful for individuals or small businesses who want to create branded links for their operations. 

### QR Code Generation:
Scissor automatically generates a QR Code image for every shortened `alias`. \
Users can download the QR code image and use it in their promotional materials and/or on their website. 

### Link History:
Scissor allows you to see the history of `alias`'s youâ€™ve created so you can easily find and reuse them.

### Analytics:
Scissor provides basic analytics that allows you to track your `alias`'s performance. \
Users can see how many clicks and scans their `alias`'s has received. \
Analytics are provided on each `hit` where a hit is a click or scan.

These are the details of each `hit`: 

- Date and time of the `hit`
- IP address of `hit`
- Referrer (this is the name of the website the link was clicked from)
- Location (country and city) of `hit`
- Internet Service Provider of the `hit`
